            This is a personal project of [Ian Sinnott][ian]. The goal in creating 
            NoteDown was to provide a quick and easy means of taking notes during
            a conversation.

      .question
        p.q How do I use different types of notes?
        .a 
          +markdown
            There are currently two types of "special" notes that you can create that will be displayed differently than the rest. 

            * To create a question, simply add a question mark to the end of a sentence.
            * To create an action, prefix the note with an exclamation mark. Example: "!Revise project scope."

      .question
        p.q What can I use this for?
        .a
          +markdown
            Do you ever find that you forget a lot of what was said during a 
            phone call or conversation? NoteDown was designed to help with that
            problem by providing a simple and quick way to take down notes on the
            fly. Some possible use cases for NoteDown include:

            * Taking notes while on the phone with a client or customer.
            * Maintaining detailed records of important calls and conversations.
            * Revisiting past discussions to see what was said.

            The creator of NoteDown uses it for all of the above. It's free to use
            so use it however you like. If you think something is missing or want
            to see a new feature added, send us a message using the

            Yes. I currently have no plans to monetize the site.

      .question
        p.q What is Markdown and how do I use it?
        .a
          +markdown
            Markdown is a way of writing where you _write_ formatting into the text of
            your document. For example, in a traditional word processor you might 
            select a word and then click a button to make it italic. In Markdown, 
            you simply add a `_` (underscore) before and after the word: For
            example: `Markdown is _really_ useful.`.

            For a quick reference of what formatting is possible with Markdown
            check out [this Markdown Cheatsheet][md].
